# TicTacToeGame
This is the TicTacToe game which I wrote on C language.

-This program requires you to enter the first player name and second players name.

-After you typed names it will create a file that holds current names and corresponding scores of these names and displayes on the console. 

-It will write to file 0-0 if the pair of player names entered for the first time. 

-For example if first player name: "test" and second player name: "test2" it will save as 0-0 and display it as "TEST-TEST2 (0-0)" on the console.

-There will be a grid for the game which can be filled with numpad. For the bottom-left corner typing 1 is necessary and other grid places according to numpad order.

-If one player has won the game program will be terminated.
